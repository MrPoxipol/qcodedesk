  - [x] Allow users to perform updates manualy (in Tray Icon's context menu) 
  - [ ] Open topic in browser on double click on row in *Topic View*
  - [ ] Add notifications (default Qt baloon for Windows, but for Linux **libnotify**)
  - [ ] Add **Topic seen** icon to *Topic View*
  
* Milestone 1.0
  - [ ] Enable logging to user account by the app (fetching all topics, that can be seen by logged user)
